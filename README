dechap v0.1 Alpha
Written by Foeh Mannay, January 2013

PURPOSE
=======

dechap is a tool which attempts to recover login credentials from captured PPPoE CHAP authentications. It strips away any 802.1Q tags and / or MPLS labels which are present to get to the CHAP and then runs a dictionary attack against any authentications it finds.

Please see http://networkingbodges.blogspot.com/ for more information on the theory behind this.

INSTALLATION
============

Provided the OpenSSL dev libraries are installed it should be possible to simply extract the source code, cd into the directory then run "make".

USAGE
=====

There are only two parameters and both are mandatory. You must specify your capture file (original pcap format) with the -c flag and your word list with the -w flag. Here's an example:

lab@lab:~/dechap$ ./dechap -w mywords.txt -c someauths.cap
Found password "tangerine" for user user1@testisp.com.
Unable to find a password for user user2@testisp.com.
Found password "password1" for user user3@testisp.com.
Found password "Africa" for user user4@testisp.com.
Found password "Frankenstein" for user user5@testisp.com.
lab@lab:~/dechap$
